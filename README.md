# OARC_Git_Workshop

This repository is maintained by Ben Winjum for use in UCLA OARC's introductory training class on Version Control with Git and GitHub.

## Slides

* The slides are available in the file "OARC_Git_GitHub.pdf"

## Interacting with JupyterHub for class

This is not required -- all you need for the class is Git, a shell, and a text editor, so interacting with JupyterHub is not strictly necessary. However, if you will find it convenient and/or would like to mirror the class demos:

* UCLA participants (multi-factor authentication required):

  * [Go to OARC JupyterHub](https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbenjum%2FOARC_Git_Workshop&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FOARC_Git_Workshop%2F&branch=main)

* Non UCLA participants:
